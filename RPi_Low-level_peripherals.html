    Introduction

In addition to the familiar USB, Ethernet and HDMI ports, the R-Pi
offers lower-level interfaces intended to connect more directly with
chips and subsystem modules. These GPIO (general purpose I/O) signals on
the 2x13 header pins include SPI, I2C, serial UART, 3V3 and 5V power.
These interfaces are not "plug and play" but require care to avoid
miswiring. The pins use a 3V3 logic level and are not tolerant of 5V
levels, such as you might find on a 5V powered Arduino. Not yet
software-enabled are the flex cable connectors with CSI (camera serial
interface) and DSI (display serial interface), and a serial link inside
the HDMI connector called CEC (consumer electronics control).


    General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)

The layout of the Raspberry Pi Revision 1 P1 pin-header seen from the
top, containing pins useable for general purpose I/O. Colour coded to
the table. Source

General Purpose Input/Output (a.k.a. GPIO) is a generic pin on a chip
whose behavior (including whether it is an input or output pin) can be
controlled (programmed) through software.

The Raspberry Pi allows peripherals and expansion boards (such as the
Rpi Gertboard </Rpi_Gertboard>) to access the CPU by exposing the inputs
and outputs.

For further general information about GPIOs, see:the wikipedia article
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPIO>.

The production Raspberry Pi board has a 26-pin 2.54 mm (100 mil)^[1]
<#cite_note-0> expansion header, marked as P1, arranged in a 2x13 strip.
They provide 8 GPIO pins plus access to I²C, SPI, UART), as well as
+3.3 V, +5 V and GND supply lines. Pin one is the pin in the first
column and on the bottom row. ^[2] <#cite_note-1>

*GPIO voltage levels are 3.3 V and are not 5 V tolerant. There is no
over-voltage protection on the board* - the intention is that people
interested in serious interfacing will use an external board with
buffers, level conversion and analog I/O rather than soldering directly
onto the main board.

All the GPIO pins can be reconfigured to provide alternate functions,
SPI, PWM, I²C and so. At reset only pins GPIO 14 & 15 are assigned to
the alternate function UART, these two can be switched back to GPIO to
provide a total of 17 GPIO pins^[3] <#cite_note-2> . Each of their
functions and full details of how to access are detailed in the chipset
datasheet ^[4] <#cite_note-3> .

Each GPIO can interrupt, high/low/rise/fall/change.^[5] <#cite_note-4>
^[6] <#cite_note-5> There is currently no support for GPIO interrupts in
the official kernel, howewer a patch exists, requiring compilation of
modified source tree.^[7] <#cite_note-6>

GPIO input hysteresis (Schmitt trigger) can be on or off, output slew
rate can be fast or limited, and source and sink current is configurable
from 2 mA up to 16 mA. Note that chipset GPIO pins 0-27 are in the same
block and these properties are set per block, not per pin. See GPIO
Datasheet Addendum - GPIO Pads Control
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/101830961/GPIO-Pads-Control2>. Particular
attention should be applied to the note regarding SSO (Simultaneous
Switching Outputs): to avoid interference, driving currents should be
kept as low as possible.

The available alternative functions </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs> and their
corresponding pins are detailed below. These numbers are in reference to
the chipset documentation and may not match the numbers exposed in
Linux. Only fully usable functions are detailed, for some alternative
functions not all the necessary pins are available for the funtionality
to be actually used.

There is also some information on the Tutorial on Easy GPIO Hardware &
Software </RPi_Tutorial_Easy_GPIO_Hardware_%26_Software>.

Kernel boot messages go to the UART </RPi_Serial_Connection> at
115200 bit/s.

*R-Pi PCB Revision 2 UPDATE:* According to Eben at [1]
<http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1929#comment-31646> the R-Pi Rev.2
board being rolled out starting in September 2012 adds 4 more GPIO on a
new connector called P5, and changes some of the existing P1 GPIO
pinouts. On Rev2, GPIO_GEN2 [BCM2835/GPIO27] is routed to P1 pin 13, and
changes what was SCL0/SDA0 to SCL1/SDA1: SCL1 [BCM2835/GPIO3] is routed
to P1 pin 5, SDA1 [BCM2835/GPIO2] is routed to P1 pin 3. Also the power
and ground connections previously marked "Do Not Connect" on P1 will
remain as connected, specifically: P1-04:+5V0, P1-09:GND, P1-14:GND,
P1-17:+3V3, P1-20:GND, P1-25:GND. According to this comment [2]
<http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2081#comment-33577> the P1 pinout
is not expected to change in future beyond the current Rev.2 layout.

^[8] <#cite_note-7>

Pin 3 (SDA0) and Pin 5 (SCL0) are preset to be used as an I²C interface.
So there are 1.8 kilohm pulls up resistors on the board for these
pins.^[9] <#cite_note-8>

Pin 12 supports PWM.

It is also possible to reconfigure GPIO connector pins P1-7, 15, 16, 18,
22 (chipset GPIOs 4 and 22 to 25) to provide an ARM JTAG interface.^[10]
<#cite_note-9> However ARM_TMS isn't available on the GPIO connector
(chipset pin 12 or 27 is needed). Chipset pin 27 is available on S5, the
CSI camera interface however.

It is also possible to reconfigure GPIO connector pins P1-12 and 13
(chipset GPIO 18 and 21) to provide an I2S (a hardware modification may
be required^[11] <#cite_note-I2S-10> ) or PCM interface.^[12]
<#cite_note-11> However, PCM_FS and PCM_DIN (chipset pins 19 and 20) are
needed for I2S or PCM.

A second I²C interface (GPIO02_ALT0 is SDA1 and GPIO03_ALT0 is SCL1) and
two further GPIOs (GPIO05_ALT0 is GPCLK1, and GPIO27) are available on
S5, the CSI camera interface.


      Referring to pins on the Expansion header

The header is referred to as "The GPIO Connector (P1)". To avoid
nomenclature confusion between Broadcom signal names on the SoC and pin
names on the expansion header, the following naming is highly recommended.

  * The expansion header is referred to as "Expansion Header" or "GPIO
    Connector (P1)"
  * Pins on the GPIO connector (P1) are referred to as P1-01, etc.
  * Names GPIO0, GPIO1, GPIOx-ALTy, etc. refer to the signal names on
    the SoC as enumerated in the Broadcom datasheet, where "x" matches
    BCM2835 number (without leading zero) and "y" is the alternate
    number column 0 to 5 on page 102-103 of the Broadcom document. For
    example, depending on what you are describing, use either "GPIO7" to
    refer to a row of the table, and "GPIO7-ALT0" would refer to a
    specific cell of the table.
  * When refering to signal names, you should modify the Broadcom name
    slightly to minimize confusion. The Broadcom SPI bus pin names are
    fine, such as "SPI0_*" and "SPI1_*", but they didn't do the same on
    the I²C and UART pins. Instead of using "SDA0" and "SCL0", you
    should use "I2C0_SDA" and "I2C0_SCL"; and instead of "TX" or "TXD"
    and "RX" or "RXD", you should use "UART0_TXD" and "UART0_RXD". 


      Power pins

The maximum permitted current draw from the 3.3 V pins is 50 mA.

Maximum permitted current draw from the 5 V pin is the USB input current
(usually 1 A) minus any current draw from the rest of the board.^[13]
<#cite_note-12>

  * Model A: 1000 mA - 500 mA -> max current draw: 500 mA
  * Model B: 1000 mA - 700 mA -> max current draw: 300 mA 

Be very careful with the 5 V pin, because if you short it to any other
P1 pin you may permanently damage your RasPi. Before probing P1, it's a
good idea to strip a short piece of insulation off a wire and push it
over the 5 V pin so you don't accidentally touch it with a probe.


      GPIO hardware hacking

The complete list of chipset GPIO pins </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs> which are
available on the GPIO connector is:

    0 </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO0>, 1 </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO1>, 4
    </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO4>, 7 </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO7>, 8

    </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO17>, 18 </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO18>, 21
    </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO21>, 22 </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO22>, 23
    </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO23>, 24 </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO24>, 25
    </RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs#GPIO25>

As noted above, GPIO00 and 01 (SDA0 and SCL0) have 1.8 kilohm pull-up
resistors to 3.3 V.

If 17 GPIOs aren't sufficient for your project, there are a few other
signals potentially available, with varying levels of software and
hardware (soldering iron) hackery skills:

GPIO02, 03, 05 and 27 are available on S5 (the CSI interface) when a
camera peripheral is not connected to that socket, and are configured by
default to provide the functions SDA1, SCL1, CAM_CLK and CAM_GPIO
respectively. SDA1 and SCL1 have 1K6 pull-up resistors to 3.3 V.

GPIO06 is LAN_RUN and is available on pad 12 of the footprint for IC3 on
the Model A. On Model B, it is in use for the Ethernet function.

There are a few other chipset GPIO pins accessible on the PCB but are in
use:

  * GPIO16 drives status LED D5 (usually SD card access indicator)
  * GPIO28-31 are used by the board ID and are connected to resistors R3
    to R10.
  * GPIO40 and 45 are used by analogue audio and support PWM. They
    connect to the analogue audio circuitry via R21 and R27 respectively.
  * GPIO46 is HDMI hotplug detect (goes to pin 6 of IC1).
  * GPIO47 to 53 are used by the SD card interface. In particular,
    GPIO47 is SD card detect (this would seem to be a good candidate for
    re-use). GPIO47 is connected to the SD card interface card detect
    switch; GPIO48 to 53 are connected to the SD card interface via
    resistors R45 to R50. 


      P2 header

The P2 header is the VideoCore JTAG and used only during the production
of the board. It cannot be used as the ARM JTAG ^[14] <#cite_note-13> .
This connector is unpopulated in Rev 2.0 boards.

Useful P2 pins:

  * Pin 1 - 3.3V (same as P1-01, 50 mA max current draw across both of
    them)
  * Pin 7 - GND
  * Pin 8 - GND 


      P3 header

The P3 header, unpopulated, is the LAN9512 JTAG ^[15] <#cite_note-14> .


      P5 header

The P5 header was added with the release of the Revision 2.0 PCB design.

  * Pin 1 - 5V
  * Pin 2 - 3V3
  * Pin 3 - GPIO28
  * Pin 4 - GPIO29
  * Pin 5 - GPIO30
  * Pin 6 - GPIO31
  * Pin 7 - GND
  * Pin 8 - GND 

Note that the connector is intended to be mounted on the bottom of the
PCB, so that for those who put the connector on the top side, the pin
numbers are swapped. Pin 1 and pin 2 are swapped, pin 3 and 4, etc.

Note that the connector is placed JUST off-grid with respect to the P1
connector.


      P6 header

The P6 header was added with the release of the Revision 2.0 PCB design.

The P6 header can be used to connect a reset button to, which with the
PI can be reset.


      Driver support

The Foundation will not include a GPIO driver in the initial release,
standard Linux GPIO drivers should work with minimal modification.^[16]
<#cite_note-15>

The community implemented SPI and I²C drivers ^[17] <#cite_note-16> ,
which will be integrated with the new Linux pinctrl concept in a later
version of the kernel. A first compiled version as Linux modules is
available to install on the 19/04/2012 Debian image, including 1-wire
support^[18] <#cite_note-17> . The I²C and SPI driver uses the hardware
modules of the microcontroller and interrupts for low CPU usage, the
1-wire support uses bitbanging on the GPIO ports, which results in
higher CPU usage.

GordonH^[19] <#cite_note-18> wrote a (mostly) Arduino compatible/style
WiringPi library <https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/> in
C for controlling the GPIO pins.

A useful tutorial on setting up I²C driver support can be found at Robot
Electronics
<http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/raspberry_pi_examples.htm> -
look for the downloadable document rpi_i2c_setup.doc


      Graphical User Interfaces


        WebIOPi

WebIOPi <http://code.google.com/p/webiopi/> allows you to control each
GPIO with a simple web interface that you can use with any browser.
Available in PHP and Python, they both require root access, but Python
version serves HTTP itself. You can setup each GPIO as input or output
and change their states (LOW/HIGH). WebIOPi is fully customizable, so
you can use it for home remote control. It also work over Internet.
UART/SPI/I2C support will be added later. If you need some computing for
your GPIO go to code examples below.

        GPIO Driving Example (Java webapp via http)

This uses the Java webapp available at
https://bitbucket.org/sbub/rpi-gpio-webapp. Any Java application that
controls GPIO must be run as root.


host:~ sb$ curl 'http://raspberrypi:8080/handle?g0=1&g1=0'
{"g1":0,"g0":1}


        GPIO Driving Example (Shell script)

This must be done as root. To change to the root user:

sudo -i

#!/bin/sh

# GPIO numbers should be from this list
# 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

# Note that the GPIO numbers that you program here refer to the pins
# of the BCM2835 and *not* the numbers on the pin header. 
# So, if you want to activate GPIO7 on the header you should be 
# using GPIO4 in this script. Likewise if you want to activate GPIO0
# on the header you should be using GPIO17 here.

# Set up GPIO 4 and set to output
echo "4" > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/direction

# Set up GPIO 7 and set to input
echo "7" > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo "in" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio7/direction

# Write output
echo "1" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value

# Read from input
cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio7/value 

# Clean up
echo "4" > /sys/class/gpio/unexport
echo "7" > /sys/class/gpio/unexport


        GPIO Driving Example (Shell script - take 2)

You need the wiringPi library from
https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/.
Once installed, there is a new command *gpio* which can be used as a
*non-root* user to control the GPIO pins.

The man page

man gpio

has full details, but briefly:

  gpio -g mode 17 out
  gpio -g mode 18 pwm

  gpio -g write 17 1
  gpio -g pwm 18 512

The *-g* flag tells the *gpio* program to use the BCM GPIO pin numbering
scheme (otherwise it will use the wiringPi numbering scheme by default).

The gpio command can also control the internal pull-up and pull-down
resistors:

  gpio -g mode 17 up

This sets the pull-up resistor - however any change of mode, even
setting a pin that's already set as an input to an input will remove the
pull-up/pull-down resistors, so they may need to be reset.

Additionally, it can export/un-export the GPIO devices for use by other
non-root programms - e.g. Python scripts. (Although you may need to drop
the calls to GPIO.Setup() in the Python scripts, and do the setup
separately in a little shell script, or call the *gpio* program from
inside Python).

  gpio export 17 out
  gpio export 18 in

These exports GPIO-17 and sets it to output, and exports GPIO-18 and
sets it to input.

And when done:

  gpio unexport 17

The export/unexport commands always use the BCM GPIO pin numbers
regardless of the presence of the *-g* flag or not.

If you want to use the internal pull-up/down's with the /sys/class/gpio
mechanisms, then you can set them after exporting them. So:

  gpio -g export 4 in
  gpio -g mode 4 up

You can then use GPIO-4 as an input in your Python, Shell, Java, etc.
programs without the use of an external resistor to pull the pin high.
(If that's what you were after - for example, a simple push button
switch taking the pin to ground.)

A fully working example of a shell script using the GPIO pins can be
found at http://project-downloads.drogon.net/files/gpioExamples/tuxx.sh.


        GPIO Driving Example (C)

This must be done as root. To change to the root user:

sudo -i

You must also get and install the bcm2835 library, which supports GPIO
and SPI interfaces. Details and downloads from
http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835


// blink.c
//
// Example program for bcm2835 library
// Blinks a pin on an off every 0.5 secs
//
// After installing bcm2835, you can build this 
// with something like:
// gcc -o blink blink.c -l bcm2835
// sudo ./blink
//
// Or you can test it before installing with:
// gcc -o blink -I ../../src ../../src/bcm2835.c blink.c
// sudo ./blink

	return 1;

    // Set the pin to be an output
    bcm2835_gpio_fsel(PIN, BCM2835_GPIO_FSEL_OUTP);

    // Blink
    while (1)

        GPIO Driving Example (C#)

RaspberryPiDotNet library is available at
https://github.com/cypherkey/RaspberryPi.Net/. The library includes a
GPIOFile and GPIOMem class. The GPIOMem requires compiling Mike
McCauley's bcm2835 library above in to a shared object.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using RaspberryPiDotNet;
using System.Threading;

namespace RaspPi
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Access the GPIO pin using a static method
            GPIOFile.Write(GPIO.GPIOPins.GPIO00, true);

            // Create a new GPIO object
            GPIOMem gpio = new GPIOMem(GPIO.GPIOPins.GPIO01);
            gpio.Write(false);
        }
    }
}


        GPIO Driving Example (Ruby)

This example uses the WiringPi Ruby Gem:
http://pi.gadgetoid.co.uk/post/015-wiringpi-now-with-serial which you
can install on your Pi with "gem install wiringpi"

MY_PIN = 1

require 'wiringpi'
io = WiringPi::GPIO.new
io.mode(MY_PIN,OUTPUT)
io.write(MY_PIN,HIGH)
io.read(MY_PIN)


    MIPI CSI-2

On the production board^[20] <#cite_note-19> , the Raspberry Pi
Foundation design brings out the MIPI CSI-2 (Camera Serial
Interface^[21] <#cite_note-20> ) to a 15-way flat flex connector S5,
between the Ethernet and HDMI connectors. A compatible camera has been
discussed as working in tests and is planned for release at a later
date.^[22] <#cite_note-21> .


    DSI

On the production board, the Raspberry Pi Foundation design brings out
the DSI (Display Serial Interface^[23] <#cite_note-22> ) to a 15-way
flat flex connector labelled S2, next to Raspberry Pi logo. It has two
data lanes and a clock lane, to drive a possible future LCD screen
device. Some smart phone screens use DSI^[24] <#cite_note-23> .


    CEC

HDMI-CEC (Consumer Electronics Control for HDMI)
</CEC_(Consumer_Electronics_Control)_over_HDMI> is supported by hardware
but some driver work will be needed and currently isn't exposed into
Linux userland. Eben notes that he has seen CEC demos on the Broadcom
SoC they are using.

libCEC with Raspberry Pi support has been included in OpenELEC and will
be included in Raspbmc RC4.^[25] <#cite_note-24>

For more information about HDMI-CEC and what you could do with it on the
Raspberry Pi please see the CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) over HDMI
</CEC_(Consumer_Electronics_Control)_over_HDMI> article.
