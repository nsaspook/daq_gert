APPLICATION:  CREATING LARGE DATA OBJECTS AND THE USART

The following sample application prompts the user (via HyperTerminal) to enter
a digit between 0 and 9.  Upon receiving a character from the USART, the
program will then either output a string from an array of data or if the
character received is not between 0 and 9, output an error string.
The command line used to build this application is:

mcc18 -p 18f452 -I c:\mcc18\h example2.c

where c:\mcc18 is the directory in which the compiler is installed.
This sample application is designed for use with the MPLAB ICD2, the
PICDEM 2 Plus demo board, and the PIC18F452 device.  This sample covers the
following items:

1.  Creating large data objects
2.  Reading from and writing to the USART. 
3.  Interrupt handling (#pragma interrupt, interrupt vectors, and
    interrupt service routines)
4.  System header files
5.  Processor-specific header files
6.  #pragma sectiontype
7.  Inline assembly

Details can be found in the "MPLAB C18 C Compiler's User's Guide" under the
Examples chapter.
